# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
An analysis was performed on PyBer ride share data to determine affordability and accessibility to rides in different cities. The analysis was based on city types (Urban, Suburban, and Rural), the number of drivers per city type, and the cost of fare. This will help to determine the most profitable area to focus resources on, to increase affordability and access to rides across all city types. 
## Results
We will start of with an overview of all the data combined, then dive deeper in to the comparison to gain a better understanding to the difference's between city types.
#### Overview of data
When you look at the following chart, you will be able to see which city type has the largest number of rides per city and average cost of rides per city type.

The Urban area clearly has a large number of rides at a lower fare per city, while the Rural area is all over the place with fewer rides at mostly a higher cost. Suburban however is fairly steady among cities in the average fare range of 27 to 35 and from 12 to 23 rides per city. At a quick glace, the information in the chart tells me that ride sharing is most commonly used with in the city limits and can be attributed to  shorter travel distances causing a lower cost. Rural areas tend to have to travel a longer distance to reach the destination causing a higher fare per ride.
####  Ride count data and Ride fare data
As you can see in the following chart Rural area has a very small amount of rides, while Urban has an median of 24 rides.

Comparing this data to the following chart, even though Suburban areas have just a little more rides per city type than Rural areas. The range of fare prices varies less than Rural areas while still holding a high fare per ride range.

When to take in to account the number of driver per city type. Urban areas have a high number of drivers for the area, allowing more access to Ride Share and a stable fare rate .

Suburban areas are looking steady and the driver per ride is appropriate considering the fare rate. This could allow for drivers to make more while still getting a good ROI, looking in to adding a few addition drivers in Suburban areas would help with ease of access.

Looking over the first four months of the year, Urban areas definitely had the highest fares overall. There seems to be a spike towards the end of February and then a hard drop for all areas.

## Summary
It would be a good idea to also include distance for each ride in future analysis. Including this data could help to better understand why fares in Rural areas are so much higher than in either of the other two areas. With the data that was available you can run a campaign in the Rural areas to see if a lower rate for rides draws more people in to using the service.  If service usage does increase a possible rate reduction could happen and the addition of a few more drivers to handle the increased use. Suburban areas seem to be doing fine how they are, but Urban areas is a good place to look in to raising the rate a bit to capitalize on the high usage of service. Holidays tend to be a high usage time and with a higher number of drivers, access to service shouldn't be a big issue. You could even raise fairs from March to April in Suburban areas to help draw in more money, but I wouldn't suggest increasing the fare much.
